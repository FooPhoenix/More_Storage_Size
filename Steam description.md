[h1]More Storage Size[/h1]
[h3]Description[/h3]
More Storage Size is a familly of mods to add new storage size to the game.
Each storage has a normal part version with wall, and a special part without wall between itself and other storage parts. A new category is created for the part version without wall, so it is not the mess.
