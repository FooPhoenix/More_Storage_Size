Each storage has a normal part version with wall, and a special part without wall between itself other storage parts. A new category is created for the part version without wall, so it is not the mess.

[h3]Game Version[/h3]
The mod is updated for the game version "0.27.xx".
Note : In the future, when the game will update to the version 0.28.xx for example, if the game say this mod is outdated, activate it anyway. There is 99% chance it still works fine for future game version.
